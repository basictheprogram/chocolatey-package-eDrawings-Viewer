    <summary>eDrawings Viewer delivers the premier 3D viewing tool for the non CAD professionals</summary>
    <description>eDrawings Viewer enables anyone to quickly and easily view, print and review eDrawings, SOLIDWORKS 
    and AutoCAD DWG and DXF files. eDrawings Viewer is available for Windows, Mac and Mobile devices for true cross 
    platform design collaboration and communication.

With a highly compressed files size and exceptional ease of use, non CAD users can now investigate complex product structures, 
3D models and 2D drawings with innovative built-in interpretation tools include 3D Pointer, Virtual Folding, Point-and-click 
Animation, and Hyperlinking. In addition to 2D and 3D product data, users of eDrawings Viewer can view SOLIDWORKS Simulation 
and Plastic results to understand product performance and manufacturability.

For users of the eDrawings mobile solutions Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) modes are available to further enhance 
the rich nature of your 3D data.  AR for iOS and Android devices enable you to 'virtually see' your designs scaled correctly in it's 
real world environment.  VR is available for iOS phones using Google Cardboard to easily visualize and comunicate product ideas.

eDrawings Viewer enables easy communication for rapid prototyping and presentation purposes by saving model files in STL, TIFF, 
JPEG, or BMP formats.

The eDrawings Viewer is intended primarily for people who do not use CAD software, but need to consume and understand 3D product 
data but not create and publish eDrawings files themselves. it is available for both Windows, Mac and Mobile platforms.</description>
